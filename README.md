Run "downgrade tool.bat" it will guide you through the entire process, step by step.

if you know what you're doing/already have the values to run this, open the (hidden) "internal" folder and start a command prompt there.
the syntax for the cli tool is as follows:
dotnet DepotDownloader.dll -app <id> -depot <id> -manifest <id> -username <username> -password <password>
